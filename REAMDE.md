# Credit Card Transaction Dataset

The primary dataset for our machine learning project is the Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset, obtained from Kaggle. This dataset consists of 568,630 anonymized credit card transactions and was compiled during a research collaboration between Worldline and the Machine Learning Group of Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB). The dataset includes 30 features, such as 'Time' and 'Amount', with the remaining 28 features ('V1' to 'V28') derived from a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) transformation of the original data. This PCA transformation is crucial for maintaining privacy while retaining useful information for fraud detection. 'Time' records the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the dataset’s first transaction, and 'Amount' shows the transaction's monetary value.
